"""This example deletes a custom targeting key by its name.

To determine which custom targeting keys exist, run
get_all_custom_targeting_keys_and_values.py.

The LoadFromStorage method is pulling credentials and properties from a
"googleads.yaml" file. By default, it looks for this file in your home
directory. For more information, see the "Caching authentication information"
