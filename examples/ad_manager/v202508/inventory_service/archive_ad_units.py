"""This code example archives ad units.

The parent ad unit and all ad units underneath it will be archived. To create ad
units, run create_ad_units.py.

The LoadFromStorage method is pulling credentials and properties from a
"googleads.yaml" file. By default, it looks for this file in your home
directory. For more information, see the "Caching authentication information"
section of our README.
