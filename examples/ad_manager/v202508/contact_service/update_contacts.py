"""This code example updates contact addresses.

To determine which contacts exist, run get_all_contacts.py.

The LoadFromStorage method is pulling credentials and properties from a
"googleads.yaml" file. By default, it looks for this file in your home
directory. For more information, see the "Caching authentication information"
section of our README.
