"""This code example creates a new creative wrapper.

Creative wrappers must be associated with a LabelType.CREATIVE_WRAPPER label and
applied to ad units by AdUnit.appliedLabels. To determine which creative
wrappers exist, run get_all_creative_wrappers.py

The LoadFromStorage method is pulling credentials and properties from a
"googleads.yaml" file. By default, it looks for this file in your home
directory. For more information, see the "Caching authentication information"
section of our README.
