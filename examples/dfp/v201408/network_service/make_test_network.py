"""This example creates a test network.

You do not need to have a DFP account to run this example, but you do need to
have a Google account (created at http://www.google.com/accounts/newaccount
if you currently don't have one) that is not associated with any other DFP test
networks. Once this network is created, you can supply the network code in your
settings to make calls to other services.

Alternatively, if you do not wish to run this example, you can create a test
network at:
https://dfp-playground.appspot.com
