"""This example creates custom field options for a drop-down custom field.

Once created, custom field options can be found under the options fields of the
drop-down custom field and they cannot be deleted. To determine which custom
fields exist, run get_all_custom_fields.py.

The LoadFromStorage method is pulling credentials and properties from a
"googleads.yaml" file. By default, it looks for this file in your home
directory. For more information, see the "Caching authentication information"
section of our README.
