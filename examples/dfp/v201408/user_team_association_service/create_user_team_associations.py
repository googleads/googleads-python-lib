"""This example adds a user to a team by creating an association between them.

To determine which teams exists, run get_all_teams.py. To determine which
users exist, run get_all_users.py.

The LoadFromStorage method is pulling credentials and properties from a
"googleads.yaml" file. By default, it looks for this file in your home
directory. For more information, see the "Caching authentication information"
section of our README.
