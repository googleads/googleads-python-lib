"""This code example creates a line item creative association for a creative
set.

To create creative sets, run create_creative_set.py. To create creatives, run
create_creatives.py. To determine which LICAs exist, run get_all_licas.py.

The LoadFromStorage method is pulling credentials and properties from a
"googleads.yaml" file. By default, it looks for this file in your home
directory. For more information, see the "Caching authentication information"
section of our README.
