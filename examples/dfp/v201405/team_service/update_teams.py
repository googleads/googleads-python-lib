"""This example updates teams by adding an ad unit to a team.

To determine which teams exist, run get_all_teams.py. To determine which ad
units exist, run get_all_ad_units.py

The LoadFromStorage method is pulling credentials and properties from a
"googleads.yaml" file. By default, it looks for this file in your home
directory. For more information, see the "Caching authentication information"
section of our README.
