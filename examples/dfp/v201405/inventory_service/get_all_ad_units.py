"""This code example gets all ad units within a network.

To create ad units, run create_ad_units.py

The LoadFromStorage method is pulling credentials and properties from a
"googleads.yaml" file. By default, it looks for this file in your home
directory. For more information, see the "Caching authentication information"
section of our README.
