"""This example gets the account hierarchy under the current account.

Note: this code example won't work with test accounts. See
https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/test-accounts

The LoadFromStorage method is pulling credentials and properties from a
"googleads.yaml" file. By default, it looks for this file in your home
directory. For more information, see the "Caching authentication information"
section of our README.
