"""This example gets all campaigns with AWQL.

To add a campaign, run add_campaign.py.

The LoadFromStorage method is pulling credentials and properties from a
"googleads.yaml" file. By default, it looks for this file in your home
directory. For more information, see the "Caching authentication information"
