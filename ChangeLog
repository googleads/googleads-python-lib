5.0.0 -- 1/13/17:
* BREAKING CHANGE: The underlying suds client now has cache enabled. By default,
  suds uses FileCache which requires access to local file system and will break
  users using Google App Engine. For more details on how to configure or disable
  caching, see the README.
* The library will now automatically apply a monkey patch to the suds-jurko
  dependency on initialization that will modify the suds.transport.http module.
  The patch modifies HttpTransport's send method such that it can detect and
  decompress a gzip encoded SOAP body.
* Added new "enable_compression" optional keyword argument for AdWordsClient and
  DfpClient. If set True, the client will request gzip compression and
  automatically decompress the SOAP body for you. For more details on this
  feature, see:
  https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/bestpractices?hl=en#use_compression
