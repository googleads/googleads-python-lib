==================
* Fixed an issue where PQL fields weren't encoding properly / not handling None
  responses correctly. This resolves issue #9.
* Fixed an issue where the AdWords ReportDownloader would fail when downloading
  gzipped reports. Now better documents the need to use binary files in this
  case. This resolves issue #6.

  retrieving the WSDL.

==================
* The common module's LoadFromStorage method now parses the yaml file with
  safe_load rather than load.
* Fixed a typo in examples/dfa/authentication/create_dfa_client_without_yaml.py
  (the service was 'CampaignService' instead of 'campaign'). This resolves
  issue #4.
* Changed examples/dfa/authentication/create_dfa_client_without_yaml.py to run
  against the DFA test environment in order to match all other DFA examples.
* Changed common._PackForSuds to force suds to serialize empty objects into XML.

  search criteria into DFA search methods in order to select everything.
