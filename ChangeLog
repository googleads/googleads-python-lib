1.0.4 - 04/22/2014
* Fixed a bug where https_proxy wasn't set for retrieving the API WSDL. This
  resolves issue #5.

1.0.3 - 04/02/2014
==================
* The common module's LoadFromStorage method now parses the yaml file with
  safe_load rather than load.
* Fixed a typo in examples/dfa/authentication/create_dfa_client_without_yaml.py
  (the service was 'CampaignService' instead of 'campaign'). This resolves
  issue #4.
* Changed examples/dfa/authentication/create_dfa_client_without_yaml.py to run
  against the DFA test environment in order to match all other DFA examples.
* Changed common._PackForSuds to force suds to serialize empty objects into XML.
  There are many use cases for this in Google's Ads APIs, such as passing empty
  search criteria into DFA search methods in order to select everything.

1.0.2 - 03/20/2014
==================
* Fixed a typo in examples/dfp/authentication/generate_refresh_token.py (there
  was a trailing comma after the scope).

1.0.1 - 03/13/2014
==================
* Fixed a bug with the AdWords ReportDownloader failing to decode unicode
  characters in reports. This resolves issue #1.
