  please report them and use your googleads.yaml file to revert back

  image assets to base64, this will be done automatically.

  provide the full URI for http_proxy and https_proxy rather than a Proxy
  instance. For an example of what these would look like, see:
  http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#proxies
- The proxy_config used in googleads.yaml has been updated to better resemble
  proxy configuration for the underlying HTTP library. The http_proxy and
  https_proxy configurations have been removed, and replaced with http and
  https. These take the full proxy URI as their value.
- Removed proxy_info attribute from ProxyConfig.
- Refactored proxy_option attribute in ProxyConfig, renamed to proxies.

5.0.0 -- 1/13/17:
* BREAKING CHANGE: The underlying suds client now has cache enabled. By default,

* Added new "enable_compression" optional keyword argument for AdWordsClient and
  DfpClient. If set True, the client will request gzip compression and
  automatically decompress the SOAP body for you. For more details on this
  feature, see:
